  Note that /neither/ Protonmail nor PGP/GPG are a good way to
  communicate if you must have 100% security, since email metadata
  is not secure. Use any application that implements the Signal
  protocol instead.

* Site
  This site’s source is on a [[https://github.com/nebhrajani-a/nebhrajani-a.github.io][GitHub repo]]. This site does not use
  trackers or any JavaScript other than [[https://www.mathjax.org][MathJax]], a program used to
  convert \(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\) code to MathML for HTML rendering. MathJax passes most
  JavaScript security extensions, including Tor's.

  As of now, no part of this site has a comment section, since I don't
  have the time to moderate it for civility.
