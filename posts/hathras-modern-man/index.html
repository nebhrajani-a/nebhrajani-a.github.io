<p>
  Not a day goes by without hearing about yet another innocent victim of
  sexual abuse and torture. It's nearly always the women getting raped,
  and the men doing the rapes. Let's genuinely get into whose fault the
  rape is, and in general, where the issue of assault, rape, and murder
  lies. We then consider which systems create those who rape, and where
  the real problems and solutions lie.
</p>


<h2>Whose Fault is Rape?</h2>

<p>
  First and foremost. Rape is never the victim's fault. Whether they
  could have done something to avoid it is irrelevant. If you're
  unthinking enough to make this argument, let me explain it like this:
  if I beat the fuck out of you because I don't like your face, is it
  your fault for having a mug I don't like, or my fault for being an
  intolerant, petty asshole? Stop blaming women for carrying their
  bodies around. Thank you, let's move on.
</p>


<h2>Social Groups of the Victims and Criminals</h2>

<p>
  Victims of many types of crime in India are either lower caste or
  lower income groups, in addition to nearly always being women. The
  criminals who rape are nearly always men. Why, then, do so many men
  rape women? Where did it all go wrong?
</p>


<h2>Solving The Real Problem</h2>

<p>
  Sex education is only a partial solution to the problem at hand. The
  problem with this solution is that it ties into the problems of the
  education system, namely, you can't educate more kids than the ones
  who turn up at schools. In addition, just knowing about consent
  doesn't mean one will follow it. Everybody knows internally that the
  solutions proposed are inadequate: because they don't really solve the
  scope of the problem.
</p>



<p>
  The following is a history and definition of the problem so that we
  can better solve it.
</p>


<h2>The Original Standard of Masculinity</h2>

<p>
  In the Vedic school of thought, femininity (Shakti) is the infinite
  energy of the universe, and masculinity (Shiva) is the organisational
  principles which hold energy packets together. This speaks of the
  strength of our ancient cultural system: as men, it is our duty to
  uphold the stability, steadiness, and rock solidity of our family, as
  much as women uphold the infinite energy and scope. Family isn't
  limited to blood relatives: Vasudeva eka kutumbakam means literally,
  the world is one family.
</p>

<p>
  In other words, as an Indian man, one is expected to be honest,
  strong, and reliable. Many men are this way: you probably don't have
  to look further than your father to see one. This is the very essence
  of what real masculinity is about: taking care of people and children,
  because real men are meant to be the bedrock of society. This isn't
  sexist: women suffer different, more chronic pain than most men,
  therefore men doing their part is perfectly fair.
</p>

<p>
  The real men were those with the most honest, true, and kind conduct:
  and those who didn't let others be dishonest, violent, and uncouth.
</p>


<h2>The Decline</h2>

<p>
  Today, being a real man means being rich, dating many women, doing
  drugs. Think Belfort in Wolf of Wall Street. This definition is the
  very problem.
</p>

<p>
  Now, I hate blaming the West as much as anybody else, but this
  definition did come from there, showing the ideal man as an arrogant
  prick who respects nobody and gets violent at the slightest
  provocation. James Bond much?
</p>

<p>
  The boys and men reading this will understand instinctively, it sounds
  much cooler to be like Jordan Belfort than to be a father of two
  working as an accountant.
</p>

<p>
  This is the declining standard of masculinity. Making cheating, lying
  scum with no integrity the holy grail of masculinity is the problem.
  This is what the West has brought to us, and what has become central
  to our narrative of masculinity.
</p>


<h2>The Problem and The Choice</h2>

<p>
  The truth is, it's much harder to be the kind of man as we described
  first than the second. I myself am not perfect or immune: I came to
  realise this distinction for how scarily universal it was only
  recently.
</p>


<p>
  The real problem statement is this: It's not in fashion to be honest,
  respectful, humble, and strong.
</p>


<p>
  It's not what society expects anymore from men. However, this is not
  where we throw our hands up and say, oh well, society is terrible.
  This is precisely where every boy reading this has a choice: to be the
  kind of man who is infinitely reliable, who upholds his integrity and
  that of society, or to be the kind of man who steals, lies, and
  cheats.
</p>


<p>
  The other scary part of the truth is: only one of these men is happy
  in the long run. The other suffers his karma one day.
</p>



<p>
  Capital punishment, castration, or public hanging won't solve this
  problem. The real solution of this problem lies in every family and
  every person: to educate themselves and others. To stop things from
  happening and raising voices.
</p>


<p>
  Nobody in the whole charade played out in UP was a real man. The PM
  and the UP CM tried to cover it up, the opposition tried to use it to
  their advantage, and the police bowed their head and did whatever
  political pressure compelled them to. Had there been one upright,
  straight man (or woman, but let's face it, the cover up was mostly
  done by men) in this process, none of this would have happened. Every
  single one was complicit in this crime, and I assure you, they will
  suffer their karma. (Also, vote them out.)
</p>


<p>
  My appeal is instead to everybody who reads this. If you're a man, be
  one who stands for what's right and opposes what's wrong. Don't be
  complicit in other's crimes. Be a protector, because you're privileged
  and strong enough to be one. And if you're already there, educate the
  men around you about what being a man means.
</p>


<h2>A (Shamefaced) Apology</h2>

<p>
  As a man, I am ashamed. Ashamed that because of boys being confused
  about what it takes to be a true man, so many women get hurt.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout I've talked about men, since men are clearly the problem
  here, but to the women, I want to say, I'm deeply sorry. I'm sorry you
  don't have the freedoms of mobility and dress, because of men. I'm
  sorry you're scared, and most of all, I'm sorry you're scared enough
  of men to change your behaviour and lifestyle because of us.
</p>


<p>
  Men, we have to improve. Raise your voice. Support women because they
  aren't screaming for no reason, they literally are drowning and in
  trauma. Just because you're horny, doesn't mean anything. You're not
  the most important and godly person in the world, and there's nothing
  empowering about hurting a woman.
</p>


<p>
  It's time to make it up to women: be a real man. Help people, teach
  men to respect women, be a protector and above all, don't expect
  encouragement or appreciation. It's your natural duty. Raise your
  voice and fists, against even your friends who threaten the safety of
  any woman.
</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  Some will find it ironic that my solution to a problem that starts
  with men is telling them to “be a man”: but that's honestly the only
  real long term solution. Stop glorifying twisted men, and instead
  glorify those who silently are the bedrock of families. I myself took
  a long time to understand this.
</p>

<p>
  The West has made this sound weak. People will call me overly
  idealistic, but the truth is the only mathematical and logical
  solution to this problem is raising the bar for men. Go out there,
  everybody, and show the world what being a man means.
</p>


<p>
  Katju, maybe women don't marry men who aren't honest, straightforward,
  and true. It's not because you're unemployed, it's because you're an
  asshole that nobody will marry you. It's these men that rape, because
  they are, by default, the men weak enough to think it's right.
</p>


<p>
  Perhaps I blame the parents more than the children here. Please, teach
  sons what it means to be a real man, and be aware of what goes on.
</p>


<p>This isn't the daughter's fault. When it is, I promise, I'll tell you.</p>
