          <p>
            In recent years, people have grown into the technology they see
            around them. This isn't to say that this wasn't the case before, but
            simply that a far greater number of people are familiar and
            comfortable with technology than ever before. A large part of this
            credit goes to mobile device makers: in particular, Apple Inc. and
            Google's Android. Nearly 60% of the world's population has an
            Internet connection, with the rest quickly catching up. This has
            meant a nearly insatiable market for flashy new software and
            hardware. Such a market seems to only have grown with the COVID-19
            worldwide quarantine. This is in stark contrast to, say, the 70s,
            when UNIX was primarily distributed to universities and used for
            research. This article is in part a trip down the memory lane, but
            it is also a lament for days when software was light and powerful.
          </p>
          <h2>Down The Memory Lane</h2>
          <p>
            Now, I'm an early 2000s kid. I saw Club Penguin come and go, and
            pretty much saw a lot of technology grow up with myself. However, I
            never saw things like a computer without a GUI, classical
            telephones, and so on. My childhood was an interesting one,
            especially with watching the advent of the Internet: but never
            really being warned about how risky it could be. It was also
            interesting watching the pre-iPhone state of the handheld computer
            market: including Palm's and Nokia's interesting, but ultimately
            doomed concepts. I digress, but the point here is that a majority of
            the people my age came into a magical world of technology, seemingly
            detached from the black-colored terminal window I'd see my parents
            typing into for a majority of their workday.

          <h3>Tools, Drag-N-Drop, and Hating It All</h3>
          <p>
            Growing up around GUIs meant that nearly every tool beginners around
            me operated had their own pretty mouse-based interface. These tools
            came and went nearly as fast as the days: from PowerPoint to Prezi
            to Canva, all these tools had one thing in common: they were
            beginner friendly. This isn't to say they were poor tools: many of
            them still exist today, and I
            hear <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/twildenh/PowerPointTM/Paper.pdf">PowerPoint
              is Turing complete.</a> A similar phenomenon was going on with text
            editors and developer tools: people were (finally) shifting away
            from the ancient vi(m) and Emacs to Eclipse, TextMate, then Sublime,
            and all sorts of other IDEs. The golden age of computing had
            arrived: everybody was a computing genius with a mouse, a pretty
            interface, and a snappy wrist to drag-and-drop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Can you blame me for getting swept away? For years, from when I
            first got my hands on my first computer (2006, I think), to 2019, I
            participated in the tools race as much as any young person could do.
            I jumped from BASIC to LOGO to Scratch, from MS Word to Prezi to
            Canva, from SuperTux (Super Mario clone) to Asphalt 8. At some
            point, however, this began to feel...forced. More inefficient than
            forced, of course, but I got disillusioned with the software I saw
            around me. Was this really how life in computing was? Bending over
            backwards to shift to the latest tool that has X feature over the
            previous one, ever in pursuit of a mythical perfect workflow? Is
            this how my parents made a living? Was this how the pros do it? And
            at some level, I began to resent it all. In 2017, I think, I
            attended an internship over a summer at Infosys Ltd., a widely
            respected IT services firm. Everybody wanted (wants?) a job there,
            or so I was told. Going there for a few weeks and seeing the
            exhausted faces of the employees, while a bearded, middle aged man
            tried to teach me how to link an SQL database to a Java program
            using Eclipse killed my interest in software for a long
            while, and my interests went elsewhere.
          </p>
          <h3>StackExchange and \(\mathrm{\TeX}\)</h3>
          <p>
            My interests having shifted to physics and mathematics, I
            went out to the Internet in my free time to indulge in
            them. I reached where everybody reaches when they need
            answers: <a href="https://www.stackexchange.com">StackExchange.</a>
            While writing answers and asking questions for the
            community, I fell in love with what everybody called
            MathJax: a JavaScript library for getting beautiful math
            on the site. Its system for typesetting equations was the
            prettiest I'd ever seen: they looked just like textbooks
            and were vector images. They looked something like this:
            \[W=\int_{r_1}^{r_2} \frac{q_1 q_2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0
            r^2} dr\] The language for formatting these was infinitely
            nicer to work with than Microsoft's toolbox for writing
            equations, which is what I'd used my whole life. It looked
            like this:
            <cite>
              $W=\int_{r_1}^{r_2} \frac{q_1 q_2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0
              r^2} dr$.
            </cite>
            Reading more about MathJax, I realised the syntax is
            actually based on a program from 1991 called
            \(\mathrm{\TeX}\), which was also used to format nearly
            every journal article I'd read. No wonder they all look so
            similar. Predictably, this led to me exploring
            \(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\), Linux, GNU, Emacs, vi...and,
            realising that there's a world of computer science that
            wasn't all about IDEs and fancy GUI tools.
