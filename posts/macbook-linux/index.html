          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            It's generally a good idea to leave Apple products alone. The
            hardware and software are tightly integrated enough that
            third-party software <em>feels</em> third party. However,
            Apple has the irritating tendency of dropping support
            within five years, leaving your otherwise good hardware
            abandoned to buy their new, latest gimmick. Not that I
            mind such a business model: it's made them a status
            symbol. This is tolerable for phones (mostly since nobody
            really makes a good phone), but it's not ideal for a
            computer. Which brings me to the object in question, an
            old 2006 MacBook my grandfather used to use, dual booted
            with Windows XP. It slowed down to a point where it was
            impossible for him to run it anymore -- although this was
            more because of malware and bloat than hardware issues --
            and came to rest in an abandoned drawer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, I had the need to take a computer somewhere, and
            lugging a 24 inch desktop around wasn't an option, so I
            turned to this MacBook. When I got it, it was running OS X
            10.6 Snow Leopard -- and wouldn't update beyond that. The
            dual boot XP was long gone. Snow Leopard is a great OS,
            but it's now too old to run anything but outdated browsers
            (the Web standard moves fast) and Aquamacs. Besides, it's
            irritating to use FreeBSD's command line tools rather than
            GNU's
            (<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/352977/why-does-this-bsd-grep-result-differ-from-gnu-grep">known
            issues</a>), and Homebrew isn't as nice to use as APT. I
            did try, and succeeded in installing Emacs 25.2 and
            MacTeX. Still, the compatible GCC was too old to support
            modern C++ standards -- unacceptable. The only option
            remaining was to install Linux, but for reasons outlined
            later, it wasn't an easy job. I'm writing this guide both
            for future reference (there's an old Mac Mini from 2006
            also), and in case it might help somebody with some old
            hardware.
          </p>
          <h2>Scope</h2>

          <p>
            In the beginning, I thought the MacBook I had was a 4,1,
            meaning that the Linux install is the standard steps, plus
            some proprietary driver installs for the Broadcom WiFi card
            and trackpad. Now, the internal Matshita DVD drive is
            broken. Tried loading the install ISO using an external
            drive and a USB, but the Apple bootloader detected none of
            these. After reading up a bit on the Internet, and
            rechecking the MacBook's specification (2,1): I came across
            <a href="https://mattgadient.com/linux-dvd-images-and-how-to-for-32-bit-efi-macs-late-2006-models/">Matt
              Gradient's website</a> which explains that the EFI
            bootloader for the laptop is 32-bit, but it does support a
            64-bit OS. That's odd in itself, but what's weirder is the
            fact that it doesn't actually boot from a 32-bit version of
            Linux either. From
            <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cdimage/+bug/1298894">an
              Ubuntu bug report</a>, it turns out that this is because, by
            default, Ubuntu and Debian ISOs offer a choice to the
            computer for which El-Torito boot image to use, and this
            doesn't sit well with the Mac. The same thread has a C
            program that zeroes out some bytes and takes away extra boot
            image options, leaving only the HFS+ boot image the Mac supports.
            Now the last remaining issue is that of making a bootable
            USB, since the internal DVD drive is broken. Turns out,
            there's a way to do this too.
          </p>

          <h2><u>Procedure</u></h2>
          <p>
            These are simplified steps that don't include a lot of
            head-banging and kernel panic issues I faced. Be warned,
            you might face this too.
          </p>

          <h3>Modding the ISO</h3>
          <p>
            Compile the C program
            (<a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-cdimage/+bug/1298894/comments/16>comment
              #16 at the bug report</a>), and pass it the ISO. It'll
            modify it. Keep the modified file safe.
          </p>

          <h3> Making a Bootable USB</h3>
          <p>
            The first thing to understand about classical EFI is that it
            sucks. The modern UEFI is a sensible
            standard that supports nearly everything you throw at it,
            but EFI 1.0 (2005) is almost made to make it difficult to use.
            Sure, I've heard people take issue with UEFI, but that's for
            another post. So, for EFI booting, "EFI interprets the boot
            image as FAT filesystem and looks up a standardized file
            path for further processing. The file name depends on the
            processor type. E.g. /EFI/BOOT/BOOTIA32.EFI for 32 bit x86
            and /EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI for 64 bit x86." However, here's
            where it gets weird. Legacy UEFI looks for this on
            a <em>separate partition</em> (type FAT32) at the lowest
            block address. However, the ISO must offer a second set of
            volume descriptors and file tree at a higher block address.
            The FAT32 EFI partition should be in an MBR-type table.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we know what we have to do, let's figure out
            how. <a href="https://mesom.de/efi32boot/index.html">Stefan's
              guide</a> is spot on, and involves writing zeros to the
            USB, then creating a MBR/DOS partition table. Then, make
            partition 1 the EFI partition, and write BOOTIA32.EFI to
            it, along with a simple GRUB2 configuration. We then
            mark <b>this partition</b> as bootable, since we want the
            MacBook to boot via legacy EFI that doesn't support
            reading boot files from ISOs. In a second
            partition, <code>dd</code> the modified ISO to the second
            partition. Pro tip: use <code>pv</code> to check what the
            pipe's up to (<code>sudo dd if=/path/to/iso | pv | sudo dd
            of=/mount/path/ bs=4M</code>). Do not mark it as bootable, or you'll be in
            trouble.
          </p>

          <h3>Plug In the USB, Boot, and Watch Install Fail</h3>
          <p>
            Now, holding the Option key while booting the Mac should
            show an option for 'EFI boot'. Select it, and boot into
            the standard install system. I used Linux Mint 19.3 XFCE.
            Open GParted. Wipe the disk (you really don't want OS X,
            do you?) and write a new partition table of type GPT. Now,
            I know that we talked about using MBR to support EFI boot,
            but somehow, MBR/DOS just doesn't work -- I think this is
            because GPT has some support for legacy EFI booting using
            a protective MBR partition -- but I'm not sure. Run
            through the install, and select the "Erase entire disk"
            option and let Mint do what it wants to.
          </p>
          <p>
            The install fails at installing GRUB2. Don't worry, this
            is because grub-config couldn't automatically figure out
            where the disks are, so we'll tell it from the GRUB2
            shell. Hold the power key till the machine boots down,
            plug out the USB, and reboot. After some time, you should
            see:
            </p>
            <pre> grub> </pre>
            <p>
            Point it to the root, load the kernel, point it to the
            INITRD.IMG, and boot.
            </p>
            <pre>grub> set root =(hd0,gpt2) #this was where / was located. Might vary depending on install, search around using TAB to find it
grub> linux /vmlinux root=/dev/sda2
grub> initrd /initrd.img
grub> boot </pre>
            <p>
              It then boots correctly. Login, then
            </p>
              <pre>$ sudo update-grub</pre>
          <p>
            Which is a neat script that configures GRUB according to
            the current boot and /etc/default/grub.
          </p>

          <h3>Welcome to Linux.</h3>
          <p>
          That completes the install. It's a bit tricky getting
          everything to work the first time, so don't give up. You can
          now configure Linux, install WiFi drivers (mine worked
          OOTB), and generally play around.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>
          The old MacBook's hardware still works well. XFCE is
          exceptionally light, so I tried Compiz with its cube
          animations, and it works smoothly. The trackpad is slightly
          jittery near buttons, leading me to believe it's some XFCE
          issue, but it's not enough to bother. What's cool is that
          this old hardware is able to run a modern Linux system with
          ease. The nVidia graphics card works too: I played
          SuperTuxKart and Neverball without any significant issues.
          Emacs runs well (that's pretty much all I need on a machine
          anyway), the daemon swallows the 'standard' 150 MiB of RAM
          in the background. \(\mathrm{\TeX}\) and GCC work as expected. It's
          pretty much a less powerful clone of my i7 desktop. I'm
          probably the only person who'll use such an old machine for
          active development work, so I'll keep this page updated with
          unexpected issues if I run into any.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a couple of annoyances: the Bluetooth doesn't
            work sometimes, and didn't work well with the audio
            devices I tried. That was also the case with OS X though,
            and I'm not energetic enough to try and fix that. The
            machine has 4 GB of RAM, but the processor only supports 3
            GB (insane, I know), but 3 GB is surprisingly enough. If
            Mint XFCE gets too heavy, I may shift to something like
            antiX or Bodhi, but that seems far away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, it's always a fun challenge bringing old hardware
            back to life: especially one with a 32-bit legacy EFI and
            broken DVD drive. Merry Christmas.
