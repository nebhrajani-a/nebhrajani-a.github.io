          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            It's generally a good idea to leave Apple products alone. The
            hardware and software are tightly integrated enough that
            third-party software <em>feels</em> third party. However,
            Apple has the irritating tendency of dropping support
            within five years, leaving your otherwise good hardware
            abandoned to buy their new, latest gimmick. Not that I
            mind such a business method: it's made them a status
            symbol. This is tolerable for phones (mostly since nobody
            really makes a good phone), but it's not ideal for a
            computer. Which brings me to the object in question, an
            old 2006 MacBook my grandfather used to use, dual booted
            with Windows XP. It slowed down to a point where it was
            impossible for him to run it anymore -- although this was
            more because of malware and bloat than hardware issues --
            and came to rest in an abandoned drawer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, I had the need to take a computer somewhere, and
            lugging a 24 inch desktop around wasn't an option, so I
            turned to this MacBook. When I got it, it was running OS X
            10.6 Snow Leopard -- and wouldn't update beyond that. The
            dual boot XP was long gone. Snow Leopard is a great OS,
            but it's now too old to run anything but outdated browsers
            and Aquamacs. Besides, it's irritating to use FreeBSD's
            command line tools rather than GNU's
            (<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/352977/why-does-this-bsd-grep-result-differ-from-gnu-grep">known
            issues</a>), and Homebrew isn't as nice to use as APT. I
            did try, and succeeded in installing Emacs 25.2 and
            MacTeX. Still, the compatible GCC was old enough to not
            support modern C++ standards -- unacceptable. The only
            option remaining was to install Linux, but for reasons
            outlined later, it wasn't an easy job. I'm writing this
            guide both for future reference (there's an old Mac Mini
            from 2006 also), and in case it might help somebody with
            some old hardware.
