  | <2021-07-12 Mon 14:11> | 1984 is one of the best books I've read in a long time.             |

  | <2021-06-17 Thu 17:36> | [[https://github.com/nebhrajani-a/sicp][SICP 1986 Video Notes]]: I've been studying SICP recently (hence the brief haitus from writing) from the 1986 Hewlett-Packard Television videos. The notes are now available as [[https://nebhrajani-a.github.io/sicp/video_notes/][HTML]] (WIP), and [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nebhrajani-a/sicp/master/video_notes/video_notes.pdf][PDF]] (recommended). Have fun going through them, and consider learning Lisp. |
