  - <2021-07-09 Fri 15:41>: Creating a microblog, since Twitter sucks and
    microblogging is fun.

  - <2021-06-17 Thu 17:36>: [[https://github.com/nebhrajani-a/sicp][SICP 1986 Video Notes]]: I've been studying SICP
    recently (hence the brief haitus from writing) from the 1986
    Hewlett-Packard Television videos. The notes are now available as
    [[https://nebhrajani-a.github.io/sicp/video_notes/][HTML]] (WIP), and [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nebhrajani-a/sicp/master/video_notes/video_notes.pdf][PDF]] (recommended). Have fun going through them,
    and consider learning Lisp.
